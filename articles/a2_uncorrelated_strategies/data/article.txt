Dynamic Allocation vs Static diversification: Can you beat passive investment?

We all know diversification is a cornetstone principle in investment management. A portfolio of uncorrelated assets reduces risk because the assets don't always rise and fall together, resulting in smoother overall returns.

Traditional diversification assumes a static allocation of capital across assets. But in practice, with changing trends, market conditions, or risk environments, a static portfolio could miss opportunities for greater returns through capital reallocation.

I want to test this and see if greater returns can be achieved using a simple momentum based dynamic allocation strategy.

First, I'll seleect three widely traded, low correlation assets: US equities (SPY), Us Treasury Bonds (IEF), and Gold. These should give a diverse spread across various growth and monetary environments. Daily price data is courced from Yahoo Finance, cover 2015 to 2025.

Static Equal Weight portfolio
This portfolio holds a constant 1/3 allocation across all three assets, rebalanced daily for consistency.
