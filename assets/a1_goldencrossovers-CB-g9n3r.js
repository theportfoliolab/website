Typically, traders of the golden cross wouldn’t advise sticking to a fixed investment horizon, and don’t normally consider volatility in their strategies.

Perhaps the lower volatility of the golden crossover strategy could lend better to shorter investment horizons, where there is less time for returns to average out. Further investigation is required.... Personally, I struggle to see the point of a lower volatility strategy in long term investment, since the buy and hold outperformed without requiring any extra effort or cost. To me, it feels like wasted effort to pursue the Golden Crossover for lower returns, when simple passive index investment seems to do the job more effectively. That said, I don’t want to overstate my perspective.`}),(0,c.jsx)(i,{lead:`Markets are complex, and different strategies may suit different investors’ goals. Rules can always be bent, and some exotic approaches have their place. But I remain unconvinced that the Golden Crossover is one of them. As for the trading gurus, the situation is simple. These people wouldn’t need to sell books, online courses, exclusive forums, or private consultation sessions, if their strategies were as profitable as they claim. Automated online trading is not the money printer they would have you believe. Accumulation of wealth takes time, and there’s no shortcuts.`})]})}export{u as default,l as meta};
